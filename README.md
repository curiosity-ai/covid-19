# Covid-19 Dataset Search

This repository contains the source code used to create the [Covid-19 AI-powered search](https://covid.curiosity.ai/#/home). The data in the website comes from the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=561). This website uses our AI-enabled graph and search technology to enable you to explore the dataset using machine-learning-based synonyms and find similar papers using word and graph embeddings.

The code here is used to [ingest the data](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/covid-19/tree/master/data-ingestion) in the back-end Mosaik instance, and to build the [front-end](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/covid-19/tree/master/front-end) that renders each of the data types in the system. 

To run the data ingestion, [download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=561), unzip it to a folder, and then run the data ingestion project with the following arguments:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curiosity-ai/covid-19/
cd covid-19
cd data-ingestion
dotnet run --server https://covid.curiosity.ai/api/ --token {AUTH_TOKEN} --folder {PATH_TO_DATA}
```

This script will create the required nodes & edges on the graph, and create the relationships between papers, authors, institutions & locations.

To build and publish the front-end project, we recomend you to install our CLI tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install mosaik.cli --global
```

You can test the front-end locally by building the front-end project, and then running the following from the base folder of this repository:

```bash
cd covid-19
mosaik serve --server https://covid.curiosity.ai/api/ --folder .\bin\Debug\net461\bridge\
```

Note: Building the front-end project using the ```dotnet build command``` is not yet supported. You can either install the [Bridge.Net CLI](https://bridge.net/download/), or build the project on Visual Studio.
